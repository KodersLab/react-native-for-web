workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n * panning or scolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targetted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performace way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n  /**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.
